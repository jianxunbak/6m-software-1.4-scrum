## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. In your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
I would first encourage the team to be tranparent in all processes, provide timely checks on progresses, and be able to adapt to the new requirements and process as needed. Before the start of any project, the team would identity all the product backlogs and user stories, which will outline the features and tasks needed. The team will select a few items from the backlog and create a sprint backlog, breaking it down into managable task to be completed within 2 - 4 weeks sprints.

During each sprints, all team members will participate in daily 15 minutes stand up meeings in the morning, to report on the previous day's progress, today's plans and issues faced. At the end of the sprint, we will deliver the working product increment to gather approvals or identify additional requirements and improvements from stakeholders.

Following the sprint review, all team members will conduct sprint retrospective to discuss what went well, what went wrong, and what can be improve for the next sprint. This process of reflection allows for continuous imporvements and helps the team become more efficient and more responsive to change.
